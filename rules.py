from collections import namedtuple as _namedtuple

# a mapping rule consists of the following fields:
#
# category     - the category to assign to the record
# code         - the 'code' of the original record
# namedesc     - the 'namedesc' of the original record
# otheraccount - the 'other account' of the original record
# description  - the 'description' of the original record
#
# When more than 1 field is set (i.e. not None), all these fields should match
# before the category is assigned to the record. A field 'matches' when the
# defined string in the rule is a substring of the field in the record
# (case-sensitive).
#
# run yac2qc.py with the -u parameter to get an idea about missing rules.

# These should be modified for your own needs. Comments can be deleted.
